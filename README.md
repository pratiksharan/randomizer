# Randomizer 🎲

I built **Randomizer** as a small side project to learn Javascript. 
It’s a lightweight web app made with **Vanilla JavaScript** that shows random memes, jokes, or quotes on click.

I just wanted to play around with **DOM manipulation** and make something interactive without using any backend or fancy setup.  
Everything runs client-side and it’s hosted on GitHub Pages.
